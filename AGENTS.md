# AGENTS.md — earcon

Instructions for humans and coding agents working in this repository.

## Baseline

- Package manager and test runner: bun only (never npm/yarn/pnpm for installs).
- Task runner: `just`, one `justfile` at the root.
- Config files use `.yaml`, never `.yml`.
- TDD (red → green → refactor); structural and behavioural changes in separate
  commits; Conventional Commits with the package as scope (`feat(core): …`).
- Never weaken a gate to make it pass; fix the cause.

## What this repo is

A bun workspace publishing three ESM packages (`@earcon/core`, `@earcon/engine-tone`,
`@earcon/react`) plus `apps/demo` (Vite). The design is fixed by a private spec
(not in the repo); deviations and interpretations are recorded in `docs/adr/`.

## Hard rules

- `packages/core/src` never references `Date`, `performance`, timers, `window`,
  `globalThis`. Time arrives as arguments (`Sample.t`, `tick(nowMs)`). Enforced by
  `.semgrep/rules/earcon-core-no-time.yaml` and `packages/core/src/purity.test.ts`.
- `@earcon/react` imports only `@earcon/core` (the `Engine` interface), never
  `@earcon/engine-tone` or `tone`.
- `tone` is never statically imported from `packages/engine-tone/src/index.ts`;
  it is loaded inside `unlock()`.
- Every millisecond handed to `core` is on the `performance.now()` axis. Never pass
  AudioContext seconds.
- Unit tests are colocated (`src/*.test.ts`, `bun:test`). Playwright tests live in
  `tests/e2e/`. No mocks in e2e.

## Git

`main` is pull-request only (repository ruleset, no bypass). Branch, push, open a
PR, wait for `check` and `e2e`, squash-merge. Version bumps arrive as the bot's
"Version Packages" PR; approve its workflow run, then merge it.

## Release

Publishing goes through `.github/workflows/release.yaml` with npm Trusted
Publishing. The publish step runs `bunx npm publish` — the single sanctioned
exception to "bun only", because `bun publish` has no OIDC/provenance (ADR-0007).
Never run `bun publish`; never put an npm token in CI. Procedure: `docs/release.md`.

## Commands

`just check` is the gate (`tsc -b`, semgrep, `bun test`, core coverage ≥ 90%).
`just test-e2e` needs `bunx playwright install chromium` once.

## Docs

`docs/intent.md` (why), `docs/handover.md` (where we are), `docs/adr/` (why we
deviated), `docs/spec-coverage.md` (spec test id → test name).
